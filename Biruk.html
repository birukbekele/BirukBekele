    Emerging technology is a term generally used to describe a new technology, but it may also refer to
     the continuing development of existing technology; it can
      have slightly different meanings when used in different 
      areas, such as media, business, science, or education.
       The term commonly refers to technologies that are currently 
       developing, or that are expected to be available within the 
       next five to ten years, and is usually reserved for technologies that are creating or are expected to create
    9significant social or economic effects. Technological evolution is a theory of radical 
    transformation of society through technological development.
    What is the root word of technology and evolution?
    • Technology: 1610s, "discourse or treatise on an art or the arts,"
     from Greek tekhnologia "systematic treatment of an art, craft, or technique," 
     originally referring to grammar, from tekhno- (see techno-) + -logy.
      The meaning "science of the mechanical and industrial arts" is first recorded in 1859.
    • Evolution: evolution means the process of
     developing by gradual changes. This noun is from Latin evolutio, 
     "an unrolling or opening," combined from the prefix e-, "out," plus volvere, "to roll."
