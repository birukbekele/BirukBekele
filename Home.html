    Artificial defines "man-made," and intelligence defines "thinking power", or “the ability to learn and 
    solve problems” hence Artificial Intelligence means "a man-made thinking power."
    So, we can define Artificial Intelligence (AI) as the branch of computer science by which we can 
    create intelligent machines which can behave like a human, think like humans, and able to make decisions.
    Intelligence, as we know, is the ability to acquire and apply knowledge. Knowledge is the information
     acquired through experience. Experience is the knowledge gained through exposure (training). Summing the terms up, 
     we get artificial intelligence as the “copy of something natural
    36
    (i.e., human beings) ‘WHO’ is capable of acquiring and applying the information it has gained through exposure.”
